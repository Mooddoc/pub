It’s like adding bigger numbers by breaking them down into smaller, easier parts.</p>     <hr>     <h2 id="understanding-place-value">Understanding Place Value</h2>     <p>Place value helps us know the value of each digit in a number based on its position. In a two-digit number like 34:</p>     <ul>         <li><strong>3</strong> is in the <em>tens</em> place and means 30.</li>         <li><strong>4</strong> is in the <em>ones</em> place and means 4.</li>     </ul>     <p>Understanding place value is key to adding multi-digit numbers correctly.</p>     <hr>     <h2 id="step-by-step-addition">Step-by-Step Addition</h2>         <h3 id="step-1">Step 1: Write the Numbers Vertically</h3>     <p>Write the numbers you want to add one below the other, making sure the ones, tens, hundreds places, etc., line up.</p>     <hr>         <h3 id="step-2">Step 2: Add the Ones Place</h3>     <p>Start adding from the rightmost digit, the ones place.</p>     <hr>         <h3 id="step-3">Step 3: Carry Over if Needed</h3>     <p>If the sum of the ones place is 10 or more, carry over the extra value to the next place (tens).</p>     <hr>         <h3 id="step-4">Step 4: Add the Tens Place</h3>     <p>Add the digits in the tens place, including any carry-over from the ones place.</p>     <hr>         <h3 id="step-5">Step 5: Continue Adding Larger Places</h3>     <p>If you have numbers with hundreds, thousands, etc., continue the same process for each place.</p>     <hr>         <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>     <h3>Example 1: Adding 23 + 45</h3>     <ol>         <li>Write the numbers vertically:             <pre>   23 + 45 ----             </pre>         </li>         <li>Add the ones place: 3 + 5 = 8.</li>         <li>Add the tens place: 2 + 4 = 6.</li>         <li>The sum is 68.</li>     </ol>         <h3>Example 2: Adding 157 + 289</h3>     <ol>         <li>Write the numbers vertically:             <pre>   157 + 289 -----             </pre>         </li>         <li>Add the ones place: 7 + 9 = 16.
