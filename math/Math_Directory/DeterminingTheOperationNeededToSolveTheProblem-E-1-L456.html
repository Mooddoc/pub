If the current population is 15,000, what was it last year?</li>         <li><em>Solution:</em> 15,000 - 1,000 = 14,000 people last year.</li>       </ul>     </li>   </ol>   <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Total, sum, combined, altogether, in all.</p>     <hr>     <h3 id="subtraction">Subtraction</h3>   <p><strong>Meaning and Use:</strong></p>   <ol>     <li><strong>Finding the Difference:</strong> Use subtraction to determine how much more or less one quantity is compared to another.       <ul>         <li><em>Example:</em> Sarah has 10 candies, and she gives 4 to her friend. How many candies does Sarah have left?</li>         <li><em>Solution:</em> 10 - 4 = 6 candies remaining.</li>       </ul>     </li>     <li><strong>Decreasing a Quantity:</strong> When a quantity is decreasing, subtraction is the appropriate operation.       <ul>         <li><em>Example:</em> A car’s fuel decreases from 50 liters to 30 liters. How much fuel was used?</li>         <li><em>Solution:</em> 50 - 30 = 20 liters used.</li>       </ul>     </li>   </ol>   <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Difference, less than, fewer, decreased by, subtract.</p>     <hr>     <h3 id="multiplication">Multiplication</h3>   <p><strong>Meaning and Use:</strong></p>   <ol>     <li><strong>Repeated Addition:</strong> Use multiplication when combining equal groups.       <ul>         <li><em>Example:</em> There are 5 bags with 4 apples each.

How many cookies does each friend get?</li>         <li><em>Solution:</em> 20 ÷ 4 = 5 cookies per friend.</li>       </ul>     </li>     <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> When organizing items into groups of a specific size, division is the appropriate operation.       <ul>         <li><em>Example:</em> There are 24 students and 6 tables.
