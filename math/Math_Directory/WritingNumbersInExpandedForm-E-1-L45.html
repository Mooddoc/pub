By breaking down numbers into their individual place values, students can grasp the concept of units, tens, hundreds, and beyond. This guide is designed for 4th and 5th graders and will cover the basics of expanded form, the rules to follow, and plenty of examples to practice.</p>   <hr>   <h2>Table of Contents</h2>   <ol>     <li><a href="#what-is-expanded-form">What is Expanded Form?</a></li>     <li><a href="#place-values">Understanding Place Values</a></li>     <li><a href="#how-to-write-expanded-form">How to Write Numbers in Expanded Form</a></li>     <li><a href="#examples">Examples</a></li>     <li><a href="#practice-questions">Practice Questions</a></li>     <li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>   </ol>   <hr>   <h2 id="what-is-expanded-form">What is Expanded Form?</h2>   <p>Expanded form is a way of writing numbers to show the value of each digit. It breaks down a number into the sum of each digit multiplied by its place value. This method helps in understanding how numbers are constructed and the value each digit holds based on its position.</p>   <hr>   <h2 id="place-values">Understanding Place Values</h2>   <p>Before writing numbers in expanded form, it's important to understand place values. Each digit in a number has a specific place value based on its position:</p>   <ul>     <li><strong>Ones</strong> (1)</li>     <li><strong>Tens</strong> (10)</li>     <li><strong>Hundreds</strong> (100)</li>     <li><strong>Thousands</strong> (1,000)</li>     <li><strong>Ten Thousands</strong> (10,000)</li>     <li><strong>Hundred Thousands</strong> (100,000)</li>     <li><strong>Millions</strong> (1,000,000)</strong></li>   </ul>   <p>For example, in the number 3,452:</p>   <ul>     <li>3 is in the thousands place</li>     <li>4 is in the hundreds place</li>     <li>5 is in the tens place</li>     <li>2 is in the ones place</li>   </ul>   <hr>   <h2 id="how-to-write-expanded-form">How to Write Numbers in Expanded Form</h2>   <p>Follow these simple steps to write a number in expanded form:</p>   <ol>     <li><strong>Identify Each Digit's Place Value:</strong> Determine the place value of each digit in the number.</li>     <li><strong>Multiply Each Digit by Its Place Value:</strong> Convert each digit into its expanded form by multiplying it by its place value.</li>     <li><strong>Add the Expanded Terms:</strong> Combine all the expanded terms using addition.</li>   </ol>   <p>Let's break it down with an example.</p>   <hr>   <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>   <h3>Example 1: Writing 4,306 in Expanded Form</h3>   <p>Step 1: Identify each digit's place value.</p>   <ul>     <li>4 is in the thousands place</li>     <li>3 is in the hundreds place</li>     <li>0 is in the tens place</li>     <li>6 is in the ones place</li>   </ul>   <p>Step 2: Multiply each digit by its place value.</p>   <ul>     <li>4 × 1,000 = 4,000</li>     <li>3 × 100 = 300</li>     <li>0 × 10 = 0</li>     <li>6 × 1 = 6</li>   </ul>   <p>Step 3: Add the expanded terms.</p>   <p><strong>Expanded Form:</strong> 4,000 + 300 + 0 + 6</p>   <h3>Example 2: Writing 52,189 in Expanded Form</h3>   <p>Step 1: Identify each digit's place value.</p>   <ul>     <li>5 is in the ten thousands place</li>     <li>2 is in the thousands place</li>     <li>1 is in the hundreds place</li>     <li>8 is in the tens place</li>     <li>9 is in the ones place</li>   </ul>   <p>Step 2: Multiply each digit by its place value.</p>   <ul>     <li>5 × 10,000 = 50,000</li>     <li>2 × 1,000 = 2,000</li>     <li>1 × 100 = 100</li>     <li>8 × 10 = 80</li>     <li>9 × 1 = 9</li>   </ul>   <p>Step 3: Add the expanded terms.</p>   <p><strong>Expanded Form:</strong> 50,000 + 2,000 + 100 + 80 + 9</p>   <hr>   <h2 id="practice-questions">Practice Questions</h2>   <p>Try writing the following numbers in expanded form:</p>   <ol>     <li>3,504</li>     <li>67,089</li>     <li>890</li>     <li>12,305</li>     <li>5,060,2</li>   </ol>   <hr>   <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>   <p>Writing numbers in expanded form is a great way to understand the value of each digit in a number.
