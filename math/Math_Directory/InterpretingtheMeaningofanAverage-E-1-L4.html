There are different types of averages, but the most common one is the <strong>mean</strong>.</p>     <h2 id="why-do-we-use-averages">Why Do We Use Averages?</h2>   <p>Averages help us:</p>   <ul>     <li>Understand data easily</li>     <li>Compare different sets of numbers</li>     <li>Make decisions based on information</li>   </ul>   <p>For example, knowing the average score of your class can help you see how everyone is doing in a test.</p>   <hr>     <h2 id="how-to-calculate-an-average">How to Calculate an Average</h2>   <p>Calculating an average is simple! Follow these steps:</p>   <ol>     <li>Add up all the numbers in the group.</li>     <li>Count how many numbers are in the group.</li>     <li>Divide the total by the number of numbers.</li>   </ol>   <p>Let’s see an example:</p>     <h3>Example:</h3>   <p>Imagine you have the following test scores: 80, 85, 90, and 95.</p>   <ol>     <li>Add the scores: 80 + 85 + 90 + 95 = 350</li>     <li>Count the scores: There are 4 scores.</li>     <li>Divide the total by the count: 350 ÷ 4 = 87.5</li>   </ol>   <p>The average score is <strong>87.5</strong>.</p>   <hr>     <h2 id="examples-of-averages">Examples of Averages</h2>     <h3>Example 1: Average Number of Pets</h3>   <p>Let’s say your friends have the following number of pets: 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4.</p>   <ol>     <li>Add the numbers: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 12</li>     <li>Count the numbers: There are 5 friends.</li>     <li>Divide the total by the count: 12 ÷ 5 = 2.4</li>   </ol>   <p>The average number of pets is <strong>2.4</strong>.</p>     <h3>Example 2: Average Score in a Game</h3>   <p>Suppose your game scores over 5 games are: 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30.</p>   <ol>     <li>Add the scores: 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 = 100</li>     <li>Count the scores: There are 5 games.</li>     <li>Divide the total by the count: 100 ÷ 5 = 20</li>   </ol>   <p>The average score is <strong>20</strong>.</p>   <hr>     <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>   <p>Understanding averages helps you make sense of numbers in a simple way. Whether you’re looking at test scores, the number of pets, or game scores, knowing the average gives you a clear picture of what is typical or common. Keep practicing how to calculate and interpret averages, and you’ll find it easier to understand the world around you!</p> </div>`
