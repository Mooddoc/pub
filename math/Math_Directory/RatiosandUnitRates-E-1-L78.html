Ratios compare two or more quantities, while unit rates express a ratio in terms of one unit of another quantity. This guide is designed to help students grasp these concepts through clear explanations and practical examples.</p>     <hr>     <h2>Table of Contents</h2>     <ol>         <li><a href="#what-are-ratios">What Are Ratios?</a></li>         <li><a href="#understanding-unit-rates">Understanding Unit Rates</a></li>         <li><a href="#general-characteristics">General Characteristics of Ratios and Unit Rates</a></li>         <li><a href="#detailed-explanation">Detailed Explanation of Ratios and Unit Rates</a>             <ul>                 <li><a href="#definitions-and-calculations">Definitions and Calculations</a></li>                 <li><a href="#simplifying-ratios">Simplifying Ratios</a></li>                 <li><a href="#finding-unit-rates">Finding Unit Rates</a></li>             </ul>         </li>         <li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>     </ol>     <hr>     <h2 id="what-are-ratios">What Are Ratios?</h2>     <p>A ratio is a comparison between two or more quantities that shows the relative sizes of each quantity. Ratios can compare any two things, such as numbers, lengths, weights, or other measurements.</p>     <p>For example:</p>     <ul>         <li>There are 3 apples and 2 oranges in a basket. The ratio of apples to oranges is 3:2.</li>         <li>The ratio of boys to girls in the class is 4:5.</li>     </ul>     <hr>     <h2 id="understanding-unit-rates">Understanding Unit Rates</h2>     <p>A unit rate is a special type of ratio that compares two different quantities where one of the quantities is one. Unit rates are useful for comparing different scenarios on a common basis.</p>     <p>For example:</p>     <ul>         <li>If a car travels 150 miles in 3 hours, the unit rate is 50 miles per hour.</li>         <li>If 5 apples cost $10, the unit rate is $2 per apple.</li>     </ul>     <hr>     <h2 id="general-characteristics">General Characteristics of Ratios and Unit Rates</h2>     <p>Before diving deeper into ratios and unit rates, it's important to understand some general rules:</p>     <ol>         <li><strong>Equivalent Ratios</strong>: Different ratios can express the same relationship. For example, 2:3 is equivalent to 4:6.</li>         <li><strong>Simplifying Ratios</strong>: Ratios can be simplified by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor.</li>         <li><strong>Comparing Ratios</strong>: Ratios can be compared by converting them to fractions or unit rates.</li>         <li><strong>Unit Rates</strong>: Always express one quantity in terms of one unit of the other quantity.</li>     </ol>     <hr>     <h2 id="detailed-explanation">Detailed Explanation of Ratios and Unit Rates</h2>     <h3 id="definitions-and-calculations">Definitions and Calculations</h3>     <p><strong>Ratio:</strong> A ratio is written in the form a:b or a to b, where a and b are quantities being compared.</p>     <p><strong>Unit Rate:</strong> A unit rate has a denominator of one, making it easier to compare different rates.</p>     <p><strong>Calculating Ratios:</strong></p>     <ol>         <li>Identify the quantities to compare.</li>         <li>Write the ratio in simplest form.</li>     </ol>     <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>     <ul>         <li>There are 8 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. The ratio of red to blue marbles is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1.</li>     </ul>     <h3 id="simplifying-ratios">Simplifying Ratios</h3>     <p>Simplifying ratios involves reducing them to their smallest whole number terms by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor (GCD).</p>     <p><strong>Steps to Simplify a Ratio:</strong></p>     <ol>         <li>Find the GCD of both terms in the ratio.</li>         <li>Divide both terms by the GCD.</li>     </ol>     <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>     <ul>         <li>Simplify the ratio 12:16.</li>         <li>GCD of 12 and 16 is 4.</li>         <li>Divide both terms by 4: 12 ÷ 4 = 3 and 16 ÷ 4 = 4.</li>         <li>So, the simplified ratio is 3:4.</li>     </ul>     <h3 id="finding-unit-rates">Finding Unit Rates</h3>     <p>To find a unit rate, divide the first quantity by the second quantity so that one of the terms becomes one.</p>     <p><strong>Steps to Find a Unit Rate:</strong></p>     <ol>         <li>Identify the two quantities in the ratio.</li>         <li>Divide the first quantity by the second to get the unit rate.</li>     </ol>     <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>     <ul>         <li>A recipe uses 6 cups of flour to make 12 cookies.

Here's a quick recap:</p>     <ul>         <li><strong>Ratio</strong>: A comparison between two or more quantities (e.g., 3:2).</li>         <li><strong>Unit Rate</strong>: A ratio where one of the quantities is one, making comparisons easier (e.g., 50 miles per hour).</li>         <li><strong>Simplifying Ratios</strong>: Reducing ratios to their simplest form by dividing by the GCD.</li>         <li><strong>Finding Unit Rates</strong>: Dividing one quantity by the other to express the ratio per one unit.</li>     </ul>     <p><strong>Remember</strong>: Practice is key to mastering ratios and unit rates.
