To effectively simplify and manipulate these expressions, it's essential to understand their building blocks:</p>   <ul>     <li><strong>Terms</strong>: The distinct parts of an expression separated by addition or subtraction.</li>     <li><strong>Coefficients</strong>: Numerical factors that multiply the variables in a term.</li>     <li><strong>Constants</strong>: Fixed numerical values that do not change.</li>   </ul>   <p>By identifying these components, you can simplify expressions, solve equations, and perform various algebraic operations with greater ease.</p>   <hr>   <h2 id="general-characteristics">General Characteristics</h2>   <p>Before delving into the specifics of terms, coefficients, and constants, it's important to recognize some general characteristics that apply to all of them:</p>   <ol>     <li><strong>Combination in Expressions</strong>: Terms, coefficients, and constants combine to form algebraic expressions.</li>     <li><strong>Role in Equations</strong>: They play crucial roles in forming and solving equations.</li>     <li><strong>Operations</strong>: Understanding these components aids in performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on expressions.</li>     <li><strong>Simplification</strong>: Identifying and combining like terms simplifies expressions, making them easier to work with.</li>   </ol>   <hr>   <h2 id="detailed-explanation">Detailed Explanation</h2>     <h3 id="terms">Terms</h3>   <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>term</em> is a single mathematical expression or a combination of numbers and variables multiplied together. Terms are separated by addition (+) or subtraction (−) signs in an algebraic expression.</p>   <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>   <ul>     <li><em>3x</em> is a term.</li>     <li><em>−5y²</em> is a term.</li>     <li><em>7</em> is a term (a constant term).</li>     <li><em>4xy</em> is a term.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Identifying Terms:</strong> To identify terms in an expression, look for parts of the expression separated by + or − signs.</p>   <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>   <ul>     <li>In the expression <em>3x + 4y − 5</em>, the terms are <em>3x</em>, <em>4y</em>, and <em>−5</em>.</li>   </ul>     <h3 id="coefficients">Coefficients</h3>   <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>coefficient</em> is a numerical factor that multiplies a variable within a term. It indicates how many times the variable is taken.</p>   <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>   <ul>     <li>In the term <em>3x</em>, the coefficient is <em>3</em>.</li>     <li>In the term <em>−5y²</em>, the coefficient is <em>−5</em>.</li>     <li>In the term <em>4xy</em>, the coefficient is <em>4</em>.</li>     <li>In the term <em>7</em>, there is no coefficient for a constant.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Identifying Coefficients:</strong> To find the coefficient in a term, look for the number that multiplies the variable.</p>   <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>   <ul>     <li>In the expression <em>6a + 2b − 3</em>, the coefficient of <em>a</em> is <em>6</em>, and the coefficient of <em>b</em> is <em>2</em>.</li>   </ul>     <h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>   <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>constant</em> is a fixed numerical value in an expression that does not change. It does not contain any variables.</p>   <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>   <ul>     <li><em>5</em> is a constant.</li>     <li><em>−7</em> is a constant.</li>     <li><em>12</em> is a constant.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Identifying Constants:</strong> Constants are the standalone numbers in an expression without any attached variables.</p>   <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>   <ul>     <li>In the expression <em>8x − 4y + 10</em>, the constant is <em>10</em>.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Special Note:</strong> Sometimes, the number 1 is implied as a coefficient and is not written explicitly. For example, in the term <em>x</em>, the coefficient is <em>1</em>.</p>     <hr>   <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>   <p>Identifying terms, coefficients, and constants is essential for simplifying algebraic expressions and solving equations effectively. Here's a quick recap:</p>   <ul>     <li><strong>Terms</strong>: The individual parts of an expression separated by + or − signs.</li>     <li><strong>Coefficients</strong>: Numerical factors multiplying the variables in terms.</li>     <li><strong>Constants</strong>: Fixed numerical values without variables.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Remember</strong>: Mastering these components will enhance your ability to manipulate and understand mathematical expressions, paving the way for success in algebra and beyond.</p>   <hr>   <p>By consistently practicing the identification and manipulation of terms, coefficients, and constants, you'll build a strong foundation in algebraic principles. Keep working through examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding and application of these fundamental concepts!</p> </div>`
