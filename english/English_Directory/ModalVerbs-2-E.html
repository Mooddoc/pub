It&#39;s <em>he can</em>, not <em>he cans</em>.</li><li><strong>Followed by Base Form</strong>: Modal verbs are followed by the base form of the main verb (the infinitive without <em>to</em>). For example, <em>She can swim</em>.</li><li><strong>No Do/Does in Questions and Negatives</strong>: Modal verbs form questions and negatives without using <em>do/does</em>. For example, <em>Can you swim?</em> and <em>He cannot (can&#39;t) swim</em>.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-modal-verbs">Detailed Explanation of Modal Verbs</h2><h3 id="should">Should</h3><p><strong>Meaning and Use:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Advice or Recommendations</strong>: <em>Should</em> is used to give advice or make recommendations.<ul><li><em>You should study for your exams.</em></li><li><em>She should see a doctor.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Expectation or Probability</strong>: It can express that something is likely or expected.<ul><li><em>They should be here by now.</em></li><li><em>The train should arrive soon.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Obligation (Less Strong than Must)</strong>: Suggests an obligation but less forceful than <em>must</em>.<ul><li><em>Employees should wear their ID badges at all times.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Conditional Sentences</strong>: Used in conditional sentences to express a possible situation.<ul><li><em>Should you need assistance, please contact us.</em></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li><em>I think you should apologize to her.</em></li><li><em>You shouldn&#39;t eat so much junk food.</em></li><li><em>Where should we go for dinner?</em></li></ul><p><strong>Negative Form:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Should not</em> or <em>shouldn&#39;t</em>.<ul><li><em>You shouldn&#39;t be late for the meeting.</em></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id="might">Might</h3><p><strong>Meaning and Use:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Possibility</strong>: <em>Might</em> expresses a small possibility or uncertainty.<ul><li><em>It might rain later.</em></li><li><em>She might come to the party.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Permission (Formal and Less Common)</strong>: Used to ask for permission politely (more formal than <em>may</em>).<ul><li><em>Might I suggest an alternative?</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Past Tense of May</strong>: In reported speech, <em>might</em> is used as the past tense of <em>may</em>.<ul><li><strong>Direct speech:</strong> <em>She said, "I may come late."</em></li><li><strong>Reported speech:</strong> <em>She said she might come late.</em></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li><em>He might not like this idea.</em></li><li><em>They might have already left.</em></li><li><em>Might you join us for dinner?</em></li></ul><p><strong>Negative Form:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Might not</em> or <em>mightn&#39;t</em> (though <em>mightn&#39;t</em> is less common and more informal).<ul><li><em>I might not go to the concert.</em></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id="can">Can</h3><p><strong>Meaning and Use:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Ability or Capacity</strong>: Indicates that someone is able to do something.<ul><li><em>I can swim.</em></li><li><em>She can speak three languages.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Permission (Informal)</strong>: Used to ask for or give permission.<ul><li><em>Can I borrow your pen?</em></li><li><em>You can leave early today.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Possibility</strong>: Expresses that something is possible.<ul><li><em>Smoking can cause cancer.</em></li><li><em>It can be very cold here in winter.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Requests</strong>: Used to make informal requests.<ul><li><em>Can you help me with this?</em></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li><em>We can&#39;t find our keys.</em></li><li><em>Can they finish the project on time?</em></li><li><em>Yes, you can use my phone.</em></li></ul><p><strong>Negative Form:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Cannot</em> or <em>can&#39;t</em>.<ul><li><em>He cannot (can&#39;t) come to the phone right now.</em></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id="must">Must</h3><p><strong>Meaning and Use:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Strong Obligation or Necessity</strong>: Indicates that something is essential or required.<ul><li><em>You must wear a seatbelt.</em></li><li><em>Students must submit their assignments by Friday.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Logical Conclusion or Certainty</strong>: Used when the speaker is sure about something.<ul><li><em>She must be at least 90 years old.</em></li><li><em>They left an hour ago; they must be home by now.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Prohibition (In Negative Form)</strong>: <em>Must not</em> indicates that something is prohibited.<ul><li><em>You must not smoke inside the building.</em></li><li><em>Visitors must not touch the exhibits.</em></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li><em>I must finish this report today.</em></li><li><em>You must be tired after your long journey.</em></li><li><em>Must we stay until the end?</em></li></ul><p><strong>Negative Form:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Must not</em> or <em>mustn&#39;t</em>.<ul><li><em>You mustn&#39;t tell anyone our secret.</em></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Understanding modal verbs is crucial for mastering English grammar.
