							<p>Once upon a time, in a cozy little <span class="tooltip"><b>village</b><span class="tooltiptext">כפר</span></span> surrounded by green hills and colorful flowers, lived a <span class="tooltip"><b>brave</b><span class="tooltiptext">אמיץ</span></span> girl named Mia. Mia loved to play with her two little sisters, Lily and Daisy. They spent their days laughing, playing games, and <span class="tooltip"><b>exploring</b><span class="tooltiptext">לחקור</span></span> the beautiful <span class="tooltip"><b>countryside</b><span class="tooltiptext">נוף כפרי</span></span> together.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>One sunny afternoon, Mia, Lily, and Daisy were playing hide and seek in the meadow. Suddenly, the sky grew dark, and the sound of <span class="tooltip"><b>flapping</b><span class="tooltiptext">להניף</span></span> wings filled the air. Three <span class="tooltip"><b>enormous</b><span class="tooltiptext">עצום</span></span>, fire-breathing <span class="tooltip"><b>dragons</b><span class="tooltiptext">דרקונים</span></span> appeared and <span class="tooltip"><b>snatched</b><span class="tooltiptext">חטף</span></span> Lily and Daisy away! Mia watched in <span class="tooltip"><b>horror</b><span class="tooltiptext">אימה</span></span> as the dragons flew towards the distant <span class="tooltip"><b>mountains</b><span class="tooltiptext">הרים</span></span>.</p>
						</div>

							<p><span class="tooltip"><b>Determined</b><span class="tooltiptext">נחוש</span></span> to rescue her sisters, Mia packed a small bag with food, water, and her favorite toy sword. She knew the journey would be <span class="tooltip"><b>dangerous</b><span class="tooltiptext">מסוכן</span></span>, but she was brave and loved her sisters dearly. Mia set off on the path towards the mountains, her heart filled with <span class="tooltip"><b>courage</b><span class="tooltiptext">אומץ</span></span> and hope.</p>

					<div class="story-page">

						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>As Mia walked through the forest, she met a wise old owl perched on a branch. The owl hooted softly, "Where are you going, little one?" Mia explained her <span class="tooltip"><b>mission</b><span class="tooltiptext">משימה</span></span> to save her sisters from the dragons. The owl nodded and gave Mia a shiny, <span class="tooltip"><b>magical</b><span class="tooltiptext">קסום</span></span> feather. "This will help you on your journey," the owl said.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>Mia continued her journey and soon reached a bubbling <span class="tooltip"><b>brook</b><span class="tooltiptext">נחל</span></span>. The water was too deep to cross, and Mia didn't know how to swim. Just then, a friendly frog hopped up and offered to help. "Hold on to my back," said the frog, "and I will take you across the water safely." Mia <span class="tooltip"><b>gratefully</b><span class="tooltiptext">בתודה</span></span> accepted the frog's help.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>On the other side of the brook, Mia entered a dark, <span class="tooltip"><b>spooky</b><span class="tooltiptext">מפחיד</span></span> cave. She could hear strange noises echoing through the tunnels. Mia took a deep breath and remembered the magical feather. She held it tightly, and it glowed, lighting up the cave. With the feather's light, Mia bravely walked deeper into the cave.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>Inside the cave, Mia <span class="tooltip"><b>encountered</b><span class="tooltiptext">נתקל</span></span> a family of bats. At first, they seemed scary, but when Mia explained her mission, the bats were kind and offered to guide her through the cave. "Follow us," they said, "and we'll show you the way out." Mia followed the bats, feeling grateful for their help.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>Mia emerged from the cave and found herself at the edge of a vast <span class="tooltip"><b>desert</b><span class="tooltiptext">מדבר</span></span>. The sun was hot, and the sand stretched as far as the eye could see. Mia took a sip of water and started walking. She knew she had to stay strong and keep going, no matter how tough the journey became.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>As Mia walked through the desert, she saw a shadow overhead. It was a giant eagle <span class="tooltip"><b>soaring</b><span class="tooltiptext">לרכוב</span></span> in the sky. The eagle swooped down and landed beside Mia. "I can fly you across the desert," said the eagle. Mia climbed onto the eagle's back, and they soared high above the sand, feeling the cool breeze on their faces.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>The eagle dropped Mia off at the edge of a dense, magical forest. The trees were tall, and their leaves <span class="tooltip"><b>sparkled</b><span class="tooltiptext">נוצץ</span></span> with a golden glow. Mia felt a sense of wonder and knew she was getting closer to the dragons' lair. She walked into the forest, her eyes wide with curiosity and determination.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>In the magical forest, Mia met a kind unicorn with a shimmering horn. The unicorn offered Mia a ride through the forest. "Hold on tight," said the unicorn, "and I'll take you to the dragons' mountain." Mia climbed onto the unicorn's back, and they <span class="tooltip"><b>galloped</b><span class="tooltiptext">דהר</span></span> through the forest, feeling the wind in their hair.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>As they reached the base of the mountain, the unicorn wished Mia good luck and <span class="tooltip"><b>vanished</b><span class="tooltiptext">נעלם</span></span> into the trees. Mia looked up at the towering mountain and felt a little scared. But she knew her sisters were waiting for her, so she started climbing the steep, rocky path with determination in her heart.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>Halfway up the mountain, Mia found a cozy cave to rest in for the night. She ate some food and drank water from her bag. As she lay down to sleep, she thought of Lily and Daisy and how much she missed them. Mia knew she had to be brave and continue her journey the next morning.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>The next day, Mia woke up early and resumed her climb. As she neared the top, she heard the sound of dragon wings <span class="tooltip"><b>flapping</b><span class="tooltiptext">להניף</span></span>. Mia peeked over a rock and saw the three dragons guarding a large, golden door. She knew her sisters were inside, and she needed a plan to save them.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>Mia remembered the magical feather the wise owl had given her. She took it out and waved it in the air. The feather glowed brightly, catching the dragons' attention. They were <span class="tooltip"><b>mesmerized</b><span class="tooltiptext">מהופנט</span></span> by the glowing feather and didn't notice Mia sneaking past them towards the golden door.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>Mia pushed open the heavy door and found herself in a grand, sparkling cave filled with <span class="tooltip"><b>treasures</b><span class="tooltiptext">אוצרות</span></span>. In the center of the cave, she saw Lily and Daisy, safe and sound but tied up with golden ropes. Mia rushed to them and used her toy sword to cut the ropes, freeing her sisters.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>Lily and Daisy hugged Mia tightly. "We knew you would come to save us!" they cried. Mia smiled and told them about her adventure. "We have to be quick," said Mia, "before the dragons notice we're gone." The sisters held hands and quietly tiptoed out of the cave.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>As they reached the golden door, the dragons noticed them and let out a <span class="tooltip"><b>roar</b><span class="tooltiptext">שאגה</span></span>. Mia held up the magical feather, and it glowed even brighter. The dragons were blinded by the light, giving Mia, Lily, and Daisy a chance to run past them and down the mountain path.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>The sisters ran as fast as they could, with the dragons chasing them. Just as the dragons were about to catch them, the friendly eagle swooped down and lifted them into the sky. "Hold on tight!" said the eagle, flying them safely away from the dragons and back to the edge of the magical forest.</p>
						</div>

					<div class="story-page">

						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>The unicorn was waiting for them at the edge of the forest. "Hop on," said the unicorn, "and I'll take you home." Mia, Lily, and Daisy climbed onto the unicorn's back, and they galloped through the magical forest, feeling happy and relieved to be together again.</p>

					<div class="story-page">
						<div class="story-page-emoji">❤️</div>
						<div class="story-page-text">
							<p>As they left the forest, the unicorn and eagle waved goodbye. Mia, Lily, and Daisy continued their journey home, crossing the desert and the brook with the help of their new friends, the frog and the bats. They thanked everyone for their kindness and help.</p>
