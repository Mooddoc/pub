Rowling</em></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Ellipsis</strong>: Use three periods (...) to indicate an omission in quoted text. <ul> <li><em>The document stated, "The parties agree ... to the terms set forth."</em></li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p> <ul> <li><em>I love reading books. It's my favorite hobby.</em></li> <li><em>She works for NASA. Her job is very interesting.</em></li> <li><em>Mr. Smith arrived at 9 a.m. for the meeting.</em></li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes</h2> <p>Be aware of these common punctuation errors:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Comma Splices</strong>: Incorrectly using a comma to join two independent clauses without a conjunction. <ul> <li>Incorrect: <em>It's raining, we can't go to the park.</em></li> <li>Correct: <em>It's raining, so we can't go to the park.</em> or <em>It's raining. We can't go to the park.</em></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Missing Comma After Introductory Elements</strong>: <ul> <li>Incorrect: <em>In conclusion the evidence supports the hypothesis.</em></li> <li>Correct: <em>In conclusion, the evidence supports the hypothesis.</em></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Overuse of Periods</strong>: Creating choppy, disconnected sentences. <ul> <li>Choppy: <em>I went to the store. I bought milk. I came home.</em></li> <li>Improved: <em>I went to the store, bought milk, and came home.</em></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Understanding how to use commas and periods correctly is crucial for clear, effective writing. Here's a quick recap:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Commas</strong>: Use for lists, joining clauses, setting off introductory elements, and enclosing non-essential information.</li> <li><strong>Periods</strong>: Use to end sentences, in abbreviations, with initials, and for ellipses.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Remember</strong>: Punctuation serves to clarify meaning and guide readers. When in doubt, read your sentence aloud to hear where natural pauses and full stops occur.</p> <hr> <p>By mastering the use of commas and periods, you'll significantly improve the clarity and professionalism of your writing. Practice regularly and don't hesitate to refer back to this guide whenever you need a refresher!</p> </div>`
